Technology world is very cruel. Failing to catch up might directly lead to incapability. On the other hand, 
it's a good fact to realize, as it actually pushes me to constantly learn something.

In software practice, it's very often to see people ignoring a number of things that are very important, like:

* code organisation
* code consistency
* documentations
* programming languages
* theories

Some might think about all these in a naive way but some might take them more seriously. The deviation of ways
of thinking among programmers brings all the chaos under the sun. The conflicts between ideas from people with
different levels of understanding are very hard to resolve. It's very interesting, or sometimes sad, to see
an almost common basis can diverge so much when it comes the time to practice.

Noticing that, it's definitely worth it to dive deeper into this computer scientific universe and it turns out
writing articles is a very helpful activity during an exploration.

So why not? Let's do it.
