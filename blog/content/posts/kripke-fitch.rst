:summary: A comparison of formulations of modal type systems in Kripke and Fitch
          styles



Summary
-------

Primary difference is that Kripke style uses context stacks while Fitch style uses
locks.  But this difference is syntactic, and primarily philosophical, not
technical. One can probably find an easy correspondence but they have different
sources of inspirations.

Kripke style, as indicated by its name, is inspired from Kripke semantics. On the
other hand, Fitch style is popularized by Clouston, who followed Borghuis. In
Borghuis' PhD thesis, he derived modal pure type systems (PTS) from Fitch's
subcoordinate proof diagrams. Technically, Fitch in Fitch style really refers to the
particular proof diagrams or form of proof presentation which Fitch invented and
Borghuis considered. However, Fitch-style systems do not really have this form of
subordination in their formulations, or do Fitch-style systems use context stacks as
Borghuis originally did (he called them generalized contexts).
