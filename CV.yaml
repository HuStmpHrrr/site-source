  I am currently a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/">McGill
  University</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a
  href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~bpientka/">Brigitte Pientka</a>.  I did my Master of
  Mathematics at the <a href="https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>,
  supervised by Professor <a href="https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~olhotak/">Ondřej
  Lhoták</a>. Before that, I worked in the industry since 2014. My undergrad was at <a
  href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/">Fudan University</a>.

  These days, I am mainly working on programming languages and formal proofs using
  proof assistants based on Martin-Löf type theory, e.g. <a
  href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a> and <a
  href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.5.4.2/">Agda</a>. I am particularly
  interested in various type theories and the mathematics behind them. As a purist, I
  insist that if a proof can be done constructively, then it needs to be; if a
  mechanized proof can be established, there is no reason not to.

  Before heading back to school, I worked as an engineer on a number of projects
  involving performance engineering, configurations, and others that you might expect
  to see in the industry. Back in my old days at Fudan University, I was more of a
  robotic guy.

  I am awarded the Postgraduate Scholarship-Doctoral by the Natural Sciences and
  Engineering Research Council of Canada.

  I am in support of 996.icu activity <a href="https://996.icu"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/link-996.icu-red.svg" alt="996.icu"></a>.

      title: Decidability and Algorithmic Analysis of Dependent Object Types (DOT)
      description: >-
        Investigation on (un)decidability and algorithmic properties of the family of DOT calculi
      link: https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/14964

      abstract: >-
        Dependent Object Types, or DOT, is a family of calculi developed to study the
        Scala programming language. These calculi have path dependent types as a
        feature, and potentially intersection types, union types and recursive
        types. So far, the study of DOT calculi mostly focuses on the soundness proof,
        which does not directly contribute to development of compilers. This thesis
        presents a detailed investigation of decidability and algorithmic properties
        of the family of DOT calculi.

        In decidability analysis, the undecidability of subtyping of several calculi
        is formally established, including the D<: and D∧ calculi. Prior to this
        investigation, the undecidability of subtyping of all DOT calculi including
        D<: was open. Decidability analysis puts emphasis on a particular form of
        subtyping rules, called normal form. It turns out that a normal form
        definition is not only as expressive, but also more suggestive than the
        original definition. A conceptual device, called small-step analysis, is
        introduced to assist converting a usual definition of subtyping to its normal
        form definition. Moreover, decidability analysis gives direct contributions to
        the algorithmic analysis, by revealing two decidable fragments of D<: in
        declarative form, called the kernels. Decidability analysis also suggests a
        novel subtyping algorithm framework, stare-at subtyping. Stare-at subtyping
        and an existing algorithm are shown to be sound and complete w.r.t. their
        corresponding kernels.

        In algorithmic analysis, stare-at subtyping is extended to other calculi, with
        more features than D<:, including D∧, μDART and jDOT. In μDART and jDOT,
        bi-directional type assignment algorithms are developed. The algorithms
        developed in this thesis are all shown to be sound with respect to their
        target calculi and terminating.

        During the development of the algorithms, analysis shows a number of ways in
        which the Wadlerfest DOT calculus does not directly correspond to the Scala
        language, while substantially increases the difficulties of algorithmic
        design. jDOT, therefore, is developed as an alternative formalization of
        Scala.

        abstract = {We describe the categorical semantics for a simply typed variant and a simplified dependently typed variant of Cocon, a contextual modal type theory where the box modality mediates between the weak function space that is used to represent higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) trees and the strong function space that describes (recursive) computations about them. What makes Cocon different from standard type theories is the presence of first-class contexts and contextual objects to describe syntax trees that are closed with respect to a given context of assumptions. Following M. Hofmann’s work, we use a presheaf model to characterise HOAS trees. Surprisingly, this model already provides the necessary structure to also model Cocon. In particular, we can capture the contextual objects of Cocon using a comonad ♭ that restricts presheaves to their closed elements. This gives a simple semantic characterisation of the invariants of contextual types (e.g. substitution invariance) and identifies Cocon as a type-theoretic syntax of presheaf models. We further extend this characterisation to dependent types using categories with families and show that we can model a fragment of Cocon without recursor in the Fitch-style dependent modal type theory presented by Birkedal et. al..},

      abstract = {The generality and pervasiveness of category theory in modern mathematics makes it a frequent and useful target of formalization. It is however quite challenging to formalize, for a variety of reasons. Agda currently (i.e. in 2020) does not have a standard, working formalization of category theory. We document our work on solving this dilemma. The formalization revealed a number of potential design choices, and we present, motivate and explain the ones we picked. In particular, we find that alternative definitions or alternative proofs from those found in standard textbooks can be advantageous, as well as "fit" Agda's type theory more smoothly. Some definitions regarded as equivalent in standard textbooks turn out to make different "universe level" assumptions, with some being more polymorphic than others. We also pay close attention to engineering issues so that the library integrates well with Agda's own standard library, as well as being compatible with as many of supported type theories in Agda as possible.},

  I am a Cantonese. My town is <a

  I like superheroes, Marvel, DC and whatever you can name.

  I played a lot of badminton during my undergrad, and now I resume to play again in Badminton Montreal!

  I have lots of video games in my Steam library, and I dream to have time to play!
