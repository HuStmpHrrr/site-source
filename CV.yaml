  I am currently a grad student at <a href="https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/">University of
  Waterloo</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a
  href="https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~olhotak/">Ondřej Lhoták</a>. Before that, I worked
  in the industry since 2014. My undergrad was at <a
  href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/">Fudan University</a>.

  These days, I am mainly working on programming languages and formal proofs using
  proof assistants based on Martin-Löf type theory, e.g. <a
  href="https://coq.inria.fr/">Coq</a> and <a
  href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.5.4.2/">Agda</a>. I am particularly
  interested in various type theories and the mathematics behind them. As a purist, I
  insist that if a proof can be done constructively, then it needs to be; if a
  mechanized proof can be established, there is no reason not to.

  Before heading back to school, I worked as an engineer on a number of projects
  involving performance engineering, configurations, and others that you might expect
  to see in the industry. Back in my old days at Fudan University, I was more of a
  robotic guy.

  My WIP master's thesis project is on <a
  href="https://gitlab.com/JasonHuZS/AlgDotCalculus">algorithmic typing of DOT</a>.

  I speak four languages: English, Mandarin, Cantonese and Japanese.

  I had 6 years of math, 2 years of physics and 1 year of chemistry olympiads experience.

  I am a Cantonese. My town is <a

  I like superheroes, Marvel, DC and whatever you can name.

  I used to play badminton during undergrad at Fudan with friends, but it turns out
  that it's hard to even find a reasonable court and shop for maintenance in Canada!

  I have lots of video games in my Steam library, and I dream to have time to play!
