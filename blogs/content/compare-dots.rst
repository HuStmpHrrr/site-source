:summary: A comparison between different versions of Dependent Object Types
          (DOTs). The thought put in this blog might or might not be published in the
          future, but nonetheless something worth mentioning before I entirely forget
          about it.

Introduction
############

Last week, Ondřej, Marianna and I was discussing the differences between two different
definitions of Dependent Object Types (DOTs). The original motivation was that I had
to make the technical decision of which DOT I am supposed to work on for my Master's
thesis. Though the decision was made before the discussion occurred, I think the
discussion was very fruitful, and it should be made public. I am not sure if the
content from this blog will eventually become a paper, because it depends on my
timeline, as well as Ondřej's. On the other hand, I suppose it's very important for a
researcher who attends to work on DOT, and wanting to make their technical decision as
well.

Here, I will focus my discussion on OOPSLA DOT [1]_ and Wadlerfest DOT [2]_.
